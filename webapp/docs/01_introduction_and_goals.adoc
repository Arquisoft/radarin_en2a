== Introduction and Goals

The aim of this system is to create an application that facilitates meetings between friends using new technologies. It uses the mobile phone location of the users willing to activate it and allows them to connect other users, their friends. 

The application will allow to notify a user when there is some friend nearby so they can get in touch.
The user will be able to be notified when one of his friends is nearby, so they can get in touch.

The system will be decentralized, compatible with a SOLID project and it will not store users' personal information in a centralized way, but will ask for permission to get to that information using users' pods.

The system will only store locations and timestamps in which those locations happen.


=== Requirements Overview



The requirements for the Radarin application are the following 

* Users should be able to know the ubications of other users who allow it. 
* Users would be able to accept others as their friends in order to share information. 
* Users would have the option to share their information with friends. 
* Users' data should be stored in the users' PODs.
* Notifications on demand would be available.

|Priority|Quality goal|Motivations
|P01 |Decentralization | Avoids security issues. We reach this goal by storing information in SOLID pods. 
|P02| Usability | The application must be understandable and easy to use for users with different levels of IT knowledge.
|P03| Performance | The application must load each web page in less than 5 seconds.
|P04| Clean code | Code should be easy to understand and easy to change.
|P05| Testability | The system should be prepared for testing puposes.
