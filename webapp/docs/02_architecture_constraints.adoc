|Constraint|Explanation
| Experience | The team members have almost no experience with some of the technologies used in this project, so that is an important constraint.
| Development time | There is a short development time for a "finished" version of this application due to the duration of the course.
| Team coordination | Although every team member should have experience in working as a team from other courses, coordination between the members will be key in the project development. 
| Non-presentiality | Due to the current circunstances we will not be able to work face-to-face with the rest of the team, so that could be an additional difficulty.
