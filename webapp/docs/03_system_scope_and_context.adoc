== System Scope and Context
.What are the goals of the system?
The main idea of this project is to create a decentralised application to facilitate meetings between friends by accessing the user's mobile phone location 
and notifying the user's friens who use Radarin aswell when they are close to each other. The system will use the SOLID technology and pods to let the users communicate 
between them ins a simple and safe way.

The communication is accomplished throught the users' SOLID pods, which allow the user to have access to its own information and the information other users share with him, 
which in this case is their location. 

=== Business Context

Due to the requirement that states that the decentralized application must implement SOLID technology, each user of the system will have a POD where its data will be stored.
 The application will establish a communication with the userâ€™s POD to read/write the required data from it.

=== Technical Context

The system is initially designed to be a web application but it is expected to work on all kinds of devices. The main idea is to build a decentralized application using the solid data pods to store users information safely.
Other technologies the system will use are the REACT framework, Docker...
