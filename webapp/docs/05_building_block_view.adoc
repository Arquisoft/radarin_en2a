== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System
This is the overview diagram of the system:

=== Scope and Context

===== Motivation
The general structure of the system is Radarin, an application to facilitate meetings between friends. User data will be stored in a decentralized way using pods, the
application will store only the minimal information of the user needed.

===== Contained building blocks
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| Radarin | The app avaliable to the user
| POD | Infraestructure used to store information for each user in a decentralized way.
|===

=== Level 1

===== Motivation
The general structure of the system is Radarin, an application to facilitate meetings between friends. User data will be stored in a decentralized way using pods, the
application will store only the minimal information of the user needed.

===== Contained building blocks
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| Application | All the code to make the application work properly.
| Tests | Several tests implemented in order to check the proper functioning of the application.
|===

=== Level 2

==== Application

===== Motivation
This is the structure that the code will have in our application.

===== Contained building blocks
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| Domain classes | Here we have some entities that will be used in the code.
| Components | This is the presentation layer of our application, including also some logic.
|===

==== Tests
===== Motivation
Unit tests, acceptance tests and load tests will be implemented and will be run automatically in a continuous integration server.

===== Contained building blocks
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| Unit tests | Tests to make the application work properly.
| Load tests |  Tests to make the application work properly.
| Acceptance tests |  Tests to make the application work properly.
|===

=== Level 3

==== Domain classes

===== Motivation
These are the entities needed in order to have the domain layer well organized.

===== Contained building blocks
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| User | Models the user of the application.
| Location | Models an specific location.
| Multimedia resource | Represents geolocalized pictures or multimedia, to enrinch specific locations.
| Message | Models messages between nearby users so they get in touch.
| Comment |  Models comments made by users in order to enrich the locations.
|===

==== Components

===== Motivation
These are all the components of the presentation layer of our application.

===== Contained building blocks
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| Login | Allows the user to log into the app if he/she has previously registered an account.
| Register | Allows the user to create a new account in order to use the application.
| Home | It is the first thing the user will see when entering the application, the welcome screen.
| Menu | A navigation bar with all the options that are avaliable to the user of the application.
| Notifications | Notifications to users that are nearby, friend suggestions, multimedia content published by friends, etc.
| Map | A dynamic map shown in screen with information about the users that are nearby.
| Friends | Allows the user to see all his/her friends in the application.
