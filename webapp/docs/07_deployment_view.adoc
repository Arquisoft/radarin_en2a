== Deployment View

As we are working with a decentralized application, our focus is the interaction between the user and the SOLID platform.
Users can interact withe platform via POD. As mentioned previously, these PODs are unique for each user. 

We will use again the schema used in part 3 to illustrate the deployment view.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

*  the distribution of your system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .. as well as the physical connections between them
*  important justification or motivation for this deployment structure
* Quality and/or performance features of the infrastructure
*  the mapping of software artifacts to elements of the infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy that section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

| _Web browser_ |Web browser to enter the application. 
|_Restapi_ | The server that runs our application.
|_Restapi client_ | Package used by the client applications to interact with the restapi server.
