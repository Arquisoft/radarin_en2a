== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain model

=== Domain concepts

In this domain model we have represented seven different entities. 

* Users can be friends to other users, they can recieve notifications from friends when they are nearby sharing their location. Users can save their location with the mobile app, by clicking in the correspondent button or with the webapp, by clicking in a point of the map. With the mobbile app, they can add comments to the location. 
* Locations have Time, Coordinates and Comments. 



=== User Experience concepts (UX)
We are going to take into account three aspects of the UX fundamental concepts: 
* Functionality: We want our application to work in the desired way. Users must be able to share their location with others as well as to store information in their PODs. 
* User interface. It is important for us that our interface is intuitive, clean and easy to manage. 
* Usability. Thr system's usability must be effortless. The less attention users have to pay to figure out how the system works, the easier will be for them to accomplish their objectives. 

=== Security and safety
SOLID enables us to store users' information in a safe way. Users can give Radarin permission to share their information with whom they want. This private information can not be shared otherwirse. 

=== Architecture and design patters. 
Radarin uses the MVC (Model Controller Architecture). 
We will use React and SOLID to develop the application.
