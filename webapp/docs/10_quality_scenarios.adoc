== Quality Requirements


[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.

=== Quality Tree

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

.Privacy
All users' personal information as well as their last known locations and their friends' lists are stored in each user's private Solid POD, which ensures that all the information remains safe and 
the application does not access anything that is not strictly needed to work and that the user hasn't agreed to.

.Usability
The idea is to make a usable application design. This is based in the idea of achieving the goals of effectiveness , efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. This is, 
the system should be easy to learn and easy to use. Furthermore the design should be flexible and robust.

.Mantainability
The application supports modifications, upgrades and other changes inside the code without causing a noticeable impact on its usability and performance.

.Decentralization
SOLID uses decentralized peer-to-peer networking which makes the system easy to use, fast and allosw for simple creation of applications by developers. The central focus is the discovery and sharing of information in a way that preserves privacy. 
Applications that are authenticated by Solid are allowed to request data if the user has given the application permission, so the user retains complete ownership and control of data in the user's pods.

.Security
Every user in tha application must log in using an identity provider like inrupt or solidcomunity, which requires a username and a password. Each pair being unique. Furthermore, decentralization 
prevents users data leak, as all their information is stored in the solid POD's, outside the application. 

.Modularity
The application divides the whole functionality into three main modules which specialize in covering several distinct requirements of the application. These modules are the webapp, the mobilapp and the restapi.


=== Quality Scenarios


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

| Quality attribute| Case  | Action | Response
| Usability| U1 |  We want to login in the application but we do not have clear the url of our POD | The application provides automatically the two most common urls to authenticate ourselves.
| Usability| U2 |  We want to see the information on the location another user shared| Just touching the marker, a pop-up shows the information the friend has shared in that location.
| Privacy | P1 |  |
| Security| S1 | A person wants to access the location of someone who doesn't have him added as a friend| He just can't as the last location is stored in the PODs as well as the list of friends in which he is not 
| Mantainability | M1 | We want to fix a bug or change a little something on the UI | Code for enhancements, bug fixing and updating some aspects of the application can be developed and tested with the application deplyed and running
