.Contents
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

.Motivation
You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

* have an identical understanding of these terms
* do not use synonyms and homonyms

.Form
A table with columns <Term> and <Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

| Term         | Definition
| Solid     | Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.
| POD    | Solid lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. All data in a pod is accessible via the Solid Protocol. When data is stored in someone's pod, they control who and what can access it.
| Load test    | Load testing generally refers to the practice of modeling the expected usage of a software program by simulating multiple users accessing the program concurrently.
| Acceptance test    | Acceptance testing in software engineering is the review process that verifies that the produced software system meets specifications and achieves its purpose.
| Unit test    | Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
| Domain layer  | The domain layer or business layer is the part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed.
| Presentation layer | The presentation layer is used to present data to the application layer (layer 7) in an accurate, well-defined and standardized format.
| Model View Controller (MVC) a|
Design pattern based on the separation of concerns, with three interconnected elements:

* Model: manages the data and business logic.
* View: what the user sees, displays the data from the Model.
* Controller: receives the user input and sends commands to the Model.
| Object Oriented Programming (OOP) | Programming paradigm based on objects which can contain data and code.
| Usability | The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness , efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
|Decentralization | The transfer of control of an activity to several separated sources rather than justa a single one
